# Debt-Free Calculator Project

You are going to build a debt-free calculator in React. A normal debt calculator will tell you how long a debt will take to be paid off. This calculator will actually keep track of your payments and overpayments.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- User enters total loan amount & interest rate
- The app will display how many monthly payments it will take to be debt-free.
- There is a "Make a payment" field. The user can set the payment amount. It will calculate the payment against the interest and deduct it from the total debt amount.
- You will require a 1% minimum payment on the principal.
- The user cannot pay less than the minimum monthly payment.
- Every time the user makes a payment:
-- the payment is recorded in a list of payments, while reducing the overall balance
-- the annual interest is calculated first
- The app must include at least two (2) components

## Future Features

- Theme toggle for light/dark mode.
- Payoff complete modal.
- Expand/Collapsable payment history.
- Export payment history to a txt file.
